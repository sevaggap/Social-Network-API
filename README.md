## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

The purpose of this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, the application uses the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

Once the repository is cloned, open the folder in an Integrated Terminal in Visual Studio Code. Run the npm seed command to seed the pre-existing user data into the database. Once this is done, run the npm start command to start the server. Navigate to Insomnia to test the routes. Happy Testing!
